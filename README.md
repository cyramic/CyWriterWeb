# CyWriterWeb

A version of the CyWriter that utilises flask, python, and html5 to do the operations instead of qt5.  Future improvements
will focus on possibly using a headless server architecture (e.g. Amazon AWS Lambda / API) to allow for a more public
deployment.  For now, this was primarily made for my own benefit.
